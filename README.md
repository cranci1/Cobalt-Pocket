# Osmium

Osmium is an iOS mobile client for Cobalt, compatible with iOS 14.2 and later.

## What is Osmium?

Osmium is a free app developed in Swift that allows users to download publicly accessible items from various known platforms.

Osmium utilizes the Cobalt API, which facilitates the downloading of media content.

As mentioned in the Cobalt API repository:

"Cobalt is NOT a piracy tool and cannot be used as such. It can only download free, publicly accessible content. Such content can be easily downloaded through any browser's dev tools. Pressing one button is easier, so I made a convenient, ad-less tool for such repeated actions."
